# Tkinter-quiz-application
To achieve a similar visual appeal and layout in a desktop GUI, you'd typically rely on: 
Frames/Layout Managers: To organize elements like the timer, question cards, and options.
Labels: For text like "Quiz App", "Time Left", questions, and answers. 
Radio Buttons: For multiple-choice selections. Progress Bars: For the timer visualization.
Explanation and How it Relates to Your Image:



QuizApp Class: Encapsulates all the quiz logic and GUI elements.

__init__ Method:Initializes the main Tkinter window (root).

Sets window title, size, and background color (mimicking the light blue-green gradient).

Defines self.questions: A list of dictionaries, each containing a question, its options, and the correct answer. This is where your quiz content resides.

Initializes current_question_index, score, total_time_per_question, and time_left.

Calls create_widgets(), display_question(), and start_timer().

create_widgets() Method:self.main_frame: A tk.Frame with a white background, mimicking the main white "card" in your web app. pack is used for basic layout.

self.title_label: "Quiz App" label.

self.time_label: Displays "Time Left: X:XX".

self.timer_canvas and self.timer_rect: This is a simple way to create a colored bar that visually represents the time left, similar to your progress bar. Tkinter's ttk.Progressbar could also be used for a more standard progress bar.

self.question_frame: Another tk.Frame for each question, with a lighter blue background, mimicking the individual question cards.

self.question_label: Displays the current question. wraplength helps with multi-line questions.

self.option_var and self.option_buttons: tk.StringVar is used to hold the selected radio button's value. A loop creates four tk.Radiobutton widgets, each associated with option_var.

self.button_frame: A frame to hold the "Submit Answer" and "Next Question" buttons.

self.submit_button and self.next_button: Standard Tkinter buttons. They are initially disabled to control flow.

display_question():Resets the timer.

Updates the question_label and option_buttons with data from self.questions based on self.current_question_index.

Clears previous radio button selection.

Disables submit_button and next_button until an action is performed.

enable_radio_buttons() / disable_radio_buttons(): Helper functions to control the state of the radio buttons.

enable_submit_button(): Ensures the "Submit Answer" button is only active when an option is selected.

submit_answer():Stops the timer.

Compares the selected_answer with the correct_answer.

Updates the score.

Shows a messagebox with the result.

Disables radio buttons and submit button, and enables the "Next Question" button.

next_question(): Increments the current_question_index and calls display_question() again.

start_timer() and update_timer():start_timer() initiates the timer.

update_timer() is called every second using root.after(1000, self.update_timer).

It decrements time_left, updates the time_label and the visual timer bar (timer_canvas).

If time_left reaches 0, it automatically calls submit_answer() (marking it as wrong if no answer was chosen) and moves to the next question.

end_quiz(): Called when all questions are answered, displays the final score, and closes the application.
